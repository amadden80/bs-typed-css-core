# CSS. Typed.

`bs-typed-css-core` is a typed interface/DSL to CSS. It is not meant to be used directly by end users, but instead by library writers who wish to provide a common, standardized interface to the parts of their library that deals with css declarations.

End-users might want to look at [glennsl/bs-typed-glamor](https://github.com/glennsl/bs-typed-glamor) instead as an implementation of this interface based on Glamor.
